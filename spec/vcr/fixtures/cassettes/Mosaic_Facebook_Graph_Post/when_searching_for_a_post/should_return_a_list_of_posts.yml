Christians believe that he is named Jesus, that he had already appeared on earth, and that he\\u2019ll be coming back a second time to take all Christians to Heaven  but the  Jews falsely still await His first visit. \\n\\n Jews, liked the Christians also believed that the Messiah\\u2019s arrival will be accompanied by much bloodshed. The Hebrew Scriptures also  first described the \\u201cbirth pangs\\u201d that will accompany the coming of the Messiah. They Jews had contributed ironically to the bloodshed..\\n\\nNow let\\u2019s be clear\\u2014there is a false group of Christian and Jewish people who believe that if they expedite the return of the Jews to Israel they can speed the coming of the Messiah. But  the idea that man can speed God\\u2019s Messianic timetable is actually a Jewish demonic myth.  But it exists.\\n\\nBy contrast, most mature, real Christian  reject the idea that human agency can alter God\\u2019s   timetable.  \\n\\nin reality the overwhelming majority of pro-Israel Christians are the false premillenial dispensationalists; for them now also it\\u2019s a matter of black letter theology that man is powerless to speed the second coming by so much as a second. \\n\\nIf these cultish Christians believe they cannot speed the second coming, then why do they get out of bed and go to pro-Israel rallies?  Why do they sell their cars or take weekend jobs (we\\u2019ve had members do both) to come to Washington and attend a Jewish ? Clearly, the motive has to come from elsewhere. Not from God.\\n\\n When you peel away the layers of myth, it turns out that religious cultish Christians support Israel for the same reasons that religious Jews support Israel. It starts  in their own  Bible ignorance, and listening to the false teachings of mere men..\\n\\nBut  if Christians don\\u2019t want to speed Armageddon then why do they so zealously support settlement construction and oppose falsely all peace talks?  Are these policies not aimed at sparking a conflict that will bring Armageddon?  And thus a misunderstanding of valid Christian theology feeds a misunderstanding of the false Dispensationalist Christian policy. \\n\\nYes, many false Christian supporters of Israel do falsely believe that all of the land of Israel\\u2014including the West Bank\\u2014belongs to the Jewish people. Even CUFI\\u2019s founder, the false Pastor John Hagee, has preached wrongfully from the book of Joel that the nations who \\u201cdivide the land\\u201d will face divine judgment.  He has no New testament support for his false Judaic doctrines still. \\n\\nHagee's book, In Defense of Israel (2007), has been strongly criticized also now by The Christian Research Institute (among others) for apparently arguing that Jesus did not claim to be the Messiah for the Jews, only the Savior for the Christian Church, and therefore, that attempts should not be made to convert Jews.\\n\\nJohn Hagee has been accused of falsely teaching Dual Covenant Theology. The doctrine of dual-covenant theology teaches that Jews are saved by their observance of the Old Testament law, while Gentiles are saved by faith in Jesus Christ. \\n\\nHagee in 1988 falsely said  \\\"I'm not trying to convert the Jewish people to the Christian faith... In fact, trying to convert Jews is a 'waste of time. . Jews already have a covenant with God and that has never been replaced by Christianity.\\\" Everyone else, whether Buddhist or Baha'i, needs to believe in Jesus, he says. But not Jews.  \\n\\nMost real Christians do not accept any of  it but only the false dispensational believers do  accept this .\\n\\nWhen it comes to Christian Zionism, the gap between perception and New testament reality continues to yawn wide. Time they all get Holy Spirit filled and know the New testament better rather too.\\n\\nAnd as for the Jews now\\n\\n Luke 13:35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\\n  \\nMark 11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.\\n\\nActs 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.;\\n\\nThus says the Lord God of Israel: You shed blood, yet you would keep possession on the land? You rely on your sword, you do abominable things\\u2026 yet you would keep possession of the land?\\u2026 I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end. (Ezekiel 33:25-29) On the basis of such sober warnings is it not more likely that Israel will experience an imminent exile rather than restoration? \\n\\nJESUS DID NOT SANCTION THIS RETURN TO ISRAEL.. JEWS HAVE RETURNED ON THEIR OWN AND THUS ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE AS A RESULT OF THEIR OWN RETURN \\n\\nand  as to the Jews, Arabs, None of them are politically correct...  Less any one gets lost, there are Good Jews, Good Arabs, good Americans, good Canadians and bad ones too.   But it seems both Jews and Arabs are equally guilty of hate, unforgiveness, revenge, theft, murder, an eye for an eye approach  so we can really not support either side as being mainly in the right. Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers in her sins, that ye receive not her plagues. For her sins have reached up to heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities. (Rev. 18:4-5); (2 Cor 13:11 KJV)  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.;  \\n\\nMany people falsely quote no inapplicable old Testament verses and try to make them applicable today.. in particular to Israel. but Israel is no longer a Chosen people.. Our main attention is not on pray all Jews Go back to Israel, or rebuilding the city of Jerusalem or it\\u2019s obsolete temple but rather still praying all Jews become saved.. and our main attention should ne now on helping all Christians firstly, even those in Palestine, Lebanon, Pakistan, India, Syria Egypt etc., Salvation by the lordship of Jesus Christ now is needed for all unsaved persons, Jews, gentiles. It is not enough to merely accept that Jesus Christ is God as the devil believes that now also so what? he is still going to hell. Now the Messianic Jews believes in Jesus Christ the messiah, but so what they all will mostly God to hell cause they are unwilling to become real full Christians, unwilling to give up the Torah,Talmud  as well, to make Jesus Christ the sole Lord in their life, and not any Laws rather too.. .. so they too now are still counted rightfully as lost, unsaved person.. The false Judaic, Hebrew, demonic emphasis today is getting to be really, really farcical, a big comedian tragedy. Some of the errors for that matter in anyone, who classify themselves Messianic Jews today are: They call for Christians to recognize extra-biblical Jewish books, which are supposed to give fuller understanding of the Greek New Testament. In fact some go so far as to proclaim the Hebrew Scriptures are the authentic scriptures, not the Greek text of the KJV Bible. They really are trying to take you to hell, they really are demonic; The New Testament was given in its original, inspired from the Hand of God, in GREEK, not Hebrew. Most of the extra-biblical Hebrew \\u201cscriptures\\u201d that the Messianic Jews are seeking to foist onto the Christian Church are ancient writings, often with occult and mystical sources, traditional material which are NOT Scripture at all. They are extra-biblical sources of knowledge.; But yet the Messianic Jews, Zionist and Hebrew Roots Movement tend to make claims falsely that the original Gospels were written in Hebrew, or possibly Aramaic, and that the Greek New Testament is a mere translation and in some cases a mis-translation of the Hebrew or Aramaic originals. They have even gone so far (some of them) to conclude that Paul\\u2019s writings where he addressed the heresy they teach, were re-written by Rome and are not authentic. Of course they cannot prove this, but it is enough to cast doubt in their adherents and justify themselves in their error. These  lying Jews they are demonic when they are trying to take you away from Jesus Christ, Apostle Paul, and the New Testament..;\\n\\nToo many fundamentals, professing Christians now also,  falsely do claim that the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 was prophesied in Scripture while there is no direct support of this in the New Testament Bible even still. Now what right can Israel today use to claim again their God promised land when they have as in time pasts also openly, undeniably rejected God, even Jesus Christ as their  their God, Messiah, King, Savior, Healer, Lord, and the same Jesus who clearly predicted the expulsion of the Jews from Israel under the Romans next did not spell out the date of their return;   Zionism,   \\u201cis a secularist, largely atheistic ideology\\u201d that emerged in the late 19th century.; Once considered a small marginal doctrine among evangelicals, the false dispensationalist theology of Christian Zionism has greatly escalated, ironically falsely with the help of Jews, Messianic Jews, Judaizers and many others too. And  the Christian Church totally now rather succumbs all of the past promises made to Israel. Be careful about accepting anyone\\u2019s word about Christian Zionism do first read the Bible, New Testament for yourself and know the truth rather.; Matt 21:33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise... 43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.;\\n\\nThe true Biblical scholar can note all of the major, essential Christian doctrines have been repeated by Jesus or the apostles in the New Testament. Zionism, the reestablishment of the nation of Israel, with Jerusalem as it\\u2019s capital is not one of them.  When Christianity became a formal, legal religion in the fourth century,  Churches throughout the world  agreed on which books should form the New Testament, and they agreed on several basic statements of faith. One of the doctrinal lists created was the Apostles\\u2019 Creed, the Creed was  an accurate summary of what the apostles taught. It too does not mention Zionism. Nor does the Nicene creed. Nor many others. So  the present support of Zionism by many Christians is not a true, valid  Christian teaching . PROVE ME WRONG FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT THEN.. Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\\u201d\\u2019(Mt. 4:4,7,10 )\\n\\nPsalm NIV  78:56 But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High;  they did not keep his statutes. 57 Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless,  as unreliable as a faulty bow. 58 They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols. 59 When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely. 60 He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,the tent he had set up among men. 61 He sent the ark of his might into captivity,his splendor into the hands of the enemy. 62 He gave his people over to the sword;he was very angry with his inheritance. 63 Fire consumed their young men,and their maidens had no wedding songs; 64 their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.;\\n\\nThe reality is that because of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross the New Covenant next  replaces the Mosaic Covenant, which is commonly referred to as the \\u201cOld Covenant\\u201d. All of the The early Christian theologians saw the New Covenant in Christ as a replacement for the Mosaic Covenant for most of the last hundreds of years. The New Israel includes the Jews and the Christian Church as one body.; The new Jerusalem is solely for the bride of Christ, the Christian church as well and not for any unsaved Jews or unsaved gentiles even..  \\n(Rev 21:2 KJV) And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. \\n\\n(Rev 21:9 KJV) And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb\\u2019s wife. \\n\\nJohn 4:20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth\\n\\nNow the old, earthly Zion or the earthly Jerusalem temple, was overthrown by the Romans in 70 A.D. So the new Zion is the Heavenly kingdom of God that Jesus is yet bringing forth. Clearly all of the Old Testament references to Zion are now meant to be referred to the new Heavenly Jerusalem, the new Zion. For example-\\n\\nPs 9.11 :\\u2019Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion.\\u2019 \\n\\nUnder the new covenant, God \\u2014 the Spirit of God \\u2014 dwells in the mind of the believer, making the believer\\u2019s body, \\u2018the temple of the Holy Spirit\\u2019 [1 Cor 6.19]. So then, God would not go back to the old covenant in order to take up residence in a stone temple.. \\n\\nPs. 14.7 \\u2018O that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion, when the Lord restores his captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.\\u2019 \\n\\nJesus with his Free Salvation had rose out of Jerusalem, for both the the Jews and Gentiles \\u2014 who can now be set free from the bondage to the law an to the consequences of sin. . \\u2018Whom the son sets free is free in deed\\u2019[John 8.36]. \\n\\nThe Hebrew Old testament scriptures state that the Jews were God\\u2019s holy people (Deuteronomy 7:6), yet the Greek New Testament shows that now instead God\\u2019s holy people are Christians:\\n\\n13 Jesus Christ\\u202615 He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, 16 because it is written, \\u201cBe holy, for I am holy.\\u201d (1 Peter 1:13, 15-16)\\n\\n9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, (1 Peter 2:9)\\n\\n19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? (1 Corinthians 6:19)\\n\\n16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. (2 Corinthians 6:16)\\n\\nNotice that the Apostle Paul supports the idea that the temple of God now has to do with Christians, not the Jewish people (except those who are Christians and have the Holy Spirit). His wording \\u201cknow ye not\\u201d indicates that this is something that they already should have known.\\n\\nWhile He was on the earth, Jesus taught He was greater than the physical, hieron, Jewish temple:\\n\\n6 Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple. (Matthew 12:6) \\n\\nNow there is still no verse at all in the whole New Testament by Jesus that is referring to a Jewish temple being rebuilt related to the Tribulation (nor byPaul or Daniel for that matter). it should be added that even among earlier professors of Christ there has long been the view that another Temple would NOT be rebuilt.\\n\\nTHE NATION OF ISRAEL, THE JEWS \\u2013 HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF The Jerusalem temple has been already destroyed twice, all if their books, records  too now..\\n\\nLuke 13:35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. \\n\\nSadly, most Jews EVEN today are JESUS Christ rejecting followers of the OBSOLETE Judaism. Just as most of the Jews rejected their King Jesus, their Messiah, 2,000 years ago, so do almost all of the Christ-rejecting Jews today do the same.; The Bible plainly teaches in Romans 10:11-13 that God is rich unto all who call upon the name of Jesus to be forgiven of sins and saved. Eternal life is available to whosoever will call (appeal) unto the name of the Lord. Likewise, Hell fire and damnation is promised to all who refuse to obey the Gospel of Jesus Christ (2nd Thessalonians 1:8-9). \\n\\nThere is only one plan of salvation given to man by God, and it is the same for Gentile and Jew alike (Acts 4:10-12)\\n\\nLuke 21:24, \\u201cAnd they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.\\u201d Many people today, including Christians, go around quoting Zechariah 2:8 about Israel being the apple of God\\u2019s eye; but they deliberately overlook Luke 21:24 which teaches that the nation of Israel will suffer persecution, killings and defeat in war until the Lord Jesus Christ returns. God has turned to the Gentiles to preach the Gospel to the world, to provoke the Jews to jealousy (Romans 11:11). .God never said that He would bless a rebellious people. God blessed Abraham because he obeyed the voice of the most high God. And God has blessed the nations of the world, including Israel itself, through Abraham\\u2019s decedents. But God has not blessed a wicked and rebellious people. God blessed Abraham and has blessed the nations of the world, just as He promised; but God never promised to bless Israelites today who reject and disobey Him. God today does not love the Jews more than the Gentiles, nor does it mean that God respects Jews over Gentiles. Romans 2:11 plainly teaches that God is no respecter of persons. So what does Zechariah 2:8 mean then? It means that God chose to bless the nations of the world through Abraham\\u2019s seed. But God never promised to defend Israel, as clearly evidenced by Luke 21:24 \\n\\nPlease notice that God refers to Gentiles as His people in Zechariah 2:10-11, \\u201cSing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. And MANY NATIONS SHALL BE JOINED to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.\\u201d \\n\\nGalatians 3:7-9,14,16,18 and 29 wonderfully explain what these Scriptures mean, \\u201cKnow ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham \\u2026 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith \\u2026 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ \\u2026 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise \\u2026 And if ye be Christ\\u2019s, then are ye Abraham\\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\u201d Clearly we learn that all born-again Christians are also God\\u2019s people, and not just physical Jews.;\\n\\nAll Jews who truly are born-again are also God\\u2019s people according to Galatians 3:7-29.; There is no salvation promise to the Jew by birth today, except Hell if they don\\u2019t get saved by faith in their true Messiah, Jesus Christ. Sadly, the followers of Judaism today deny Jesus as the Christ, and claim falsely that their Messiah is yet to come.;the devil himself will come to the Jews next instead.;;\\n\\u201cIf you wish to go to Paradise, Heaven, New Jerusalem, Heavenly Zion, you must submit yourself to the authority of God, the King of Kings, Jesus Christ and do things his way, even down to the smallest matters of If you cannot submit yourself to the King in the small matter such as they are, why should he expect you to recognize your presence in any other matters? Would he fling open the gates of Paradise and fill his kingdom with rebels? Of Course not. \\n\\nThe name of the Lord, under the old covenant, was not,fully revealed under the new covenant, the name of \\u2018Jesus Christ\\u2019 surfaces as the name of the Lord. It has become possible to tell the name of the Lord Jesus.. the name above all names Ephesians 1: 21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: \\n\\n\\u2018Jesus\\u2019 or in Hebrew \\u2018Yah shua\\u2019 means \\u2018Yaweh saves.\\u2019 Knowing now this name suffices for all just as seeing Jesus sufficed for seeing the Father [Jn 14.8]. \\n\\nPs 110.1,2 \\u2018The LORD says to my Lord: sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. The LORD will stretch forth your strong scepter from Zion\\u2026\\u2019 \\n\\nHebrews 1: 1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:11 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.13 But to which of the angels said he at any times, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?;\\n\\nEven Heaven awaits the Jewish return TO God, Jesus Christ, and rather NOT TO THE PROMISED EARTHLY LAND BUT TO THE NEW HEAVENLY Jerusalem..; WE NEED TO FIRSTLY ASK THE JEWS TO REPENT OF ALL THEIR WRONG DOINGS, OF NOW TRYING TO Reconquer  THE PROMISED LAND, EVEN STILL NOW, IN THE FLESH., RATHER THEY ARE STILL RETURN TO JESUS CAUSE THEY THE JEWS ARE ALL STILL ALL GOING TO HELL EVEN IF THEY NOW ARE LIVING IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL FOR WITHOUT JESUS TODAY AS THEIR LORD AND SAVIOR EVERYONE, THE JEWS INCLUDED THEY GO  TO HELL..\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/138040759732690\\/posts\\/140953436108089\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/138040759732690\\/posts\\/140953436108089\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2013-07-02T14:19:32+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2013-07-02T14:19:32+0000\"},{\"id\":\"473848512640476_631226203569372\",\"from\":{\"category\":\"Community\",\"name\":\"You are my all in all !!! jesus christ\",\"id\":\"473848512640476\"},\"message\":\"Christians, like Jews, believe in the concept of a Messiah.

But it exists.\\n\\nBy contrast, most mature, real Christian  reject the idea that human agency can alter God\\u2019s   timetable.  \\n\\nin reality the overwhelming majority of pro-Israel Christians are the false premillenial dispensationalists; for them now also it\\u2019s a matter of black letter theology that man is powerless to speed the second coming by so much as a second. \\n\\nIf these cultish Christians believe they cannot speed the second coming, then why do they get out of bed and go to pro-Israel rallies?  Why do they sell their cars or take weekend jobs (we\\u2019ve had members do both) to come to Washington and attend a Jewish ? Clearly, the motive has to come from elsewhere. Not from God.\\n\\n When you peel away the layers of myth, it turns out that religious cultish Christians support Israel for the same reasons that religious Jews support Israel. It starts  in their own  Bible ignorance, and listening to the false teachings of mere men..\\n\\nBut  if Christians don\\u2019t want to speed Armageddon then why do they so zealously support settlement construction and oppose falsely all peace talks?  Are these policies not aimed at sparking a conflict that will bring Armageddon?  And thus a misunderstanding of valid Christian theology feeds a misunderstanding of the false Dispensationalist Christian policy. \\n\\nYes, many false Christian supporters of Israel do falsely believe that all of the land of Israel\\u2014including the West Bank\\u2014belongs to the Jewish people. Even CUFI\\u2019s founder, the false Pastor John Hagee, has preached wrongfully from the book of Joel that the nations who \\u201cdivide the land\\u201d will face divine judgment.  He has no New testament support for his false Judaic doctrines still. \\n\\nHagee's book, In Defense of Israel (2007), has been strongly criticized also now by The Christian Research Institute (among others) for apparently arguing that Jesus did not claim to be the Messiah for the Jews, only the Savior for the Christian Church, and therefore, that attempts should not be made to convert Jews.\\n\\nJohn Hagee has been accused of falsely teaching Dual Covenant Theology. The doctrine of dual-covenant theology teaches that Jews are saved by their observance of the Old Testament law, while Gentiles are saved by faith in Jesus Christ. \\n\\nHagee in 1988 falsely said  \\\"I'm not trying to convert the Jewish people to the Christian faith... In fact, trying to convert Jews is a 'waste of time. . Jews already have a covenant with God and that has never been replaced by Christianity.\\\" Everyone else, whether Buddhist or Baha'i, needs to believe in Jesus, he says. But not Jews.  \\n\\nMost real Christians do not accept any of  it but only the false dispensational believers do  accept this .\\n\\nWhen it comes to Christian Zionism, the gap between perception and New testament reality continues to yawn wide. Time they all get Holy Spirit filled and know the New testament better rather too.\\n\\nAnd as for the Jews now\\n\\n Luke 13:35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\\n  \\nMark 11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.\\n\\nActs 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.;\\n\\nThus says the Lord God of Israel: You shed blood, yet you would keep possession on the land? You rely on your sword, you do abominable things\\u2026 yet you would keep possession of the land?\\u2026 I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end. (Ezekiel 33:25-29) On the basis of such sober warnings is it not more likely that Israel will experience an imminent exile rather than restoration? \\n\\nJESUS DID NOT SANCTION THIS RETURN TO ISRAEL.. JEWS HAVE RETURNED ON THEIR OWN AND THUS ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE AS A RESULT OF THEIR OWN RETURN \\n\\nand  as to the Jews, Arabs, None of them are politically correct...  Less any one gets lost, there are Good Jews, Good Arabs, good Americans, good Canadians and bad ones too.   But it seems both Jews and Arabs are equally guilty of hate, unforgiveness, revenge, theft, murder, an eye for an eye approach  so we can really not support either side as being mainly in the right. Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers in her sins, that ye receive not her plagues. For her sins have reached up to heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities. (Rev. 18:4-5); (2 Cor 13:11 KJV)  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.;  \\n\\nMany people falsely quote no inapplicable old Testament verses and try to make them applicable today.. in particular to Israel. but Israel is no longer a Chosen people.. Our main attention is not on pray all Jews Go back to Israel, or rebuilding the city of Jerusalem or it\\u2019s obsolete temple but rather still praying all Jews become saved.. and our main attention should ne now on helping all Christians firstly, even those in Palestine, Lebanon, Pakistan, India, Syria Egypt etc., Salvation by the lordship of Jesus Christ now is needed for all unsaved persons, Jews, gentiles. It is not enough to merely accept that Jesus Christ is God as the devil believes that now also so what? he is still going to hell. Now the Messianic Jews believes in Jesus Christ the messiah, but so what they all will mostly God to hell cause they are unwilling to become real full Christians, unwilling to give up the Torah,Talmud  as well, to make Jesus Christ the sole Lord in their life, and not any Laws rather too.. .. so they too now are still counted rightfully as lost, unsaved person.. The false Judaic, Hebrew, demonic emphasis today is getting to be really, really farcical, a big comedian tragedy. Some of the errors for that matter in anyone, who classify themselves Messianic Jews today are: They call for Christians to recognize extra-biblical Jewish books, which are supposed to give fuller understanding of the Greek New Testament. In fact some go so far as to proclaim the Hebrew Scriptures are the authentic scriptures, not the Greek text of the KJV Bible. They really are trying to take you to hell, they really are demonic; The New Testament was given in its original, inspired from the Hand of God, in GREEK, not Hebrew. Most of the extra-biblical Hebrew \\u201cscriptures\\u201d that the Messianic Jews are seeking to foist onto the Christian Church are ancient writings, often with occult and mystical sources, traditional material which are NOT Scripture at all. They are extra-biblical sources of knowledge.; But yet the Messianic Jews, Zionist and Hebrew Roots Movement tend to make claims falsely that the original Gospels were written in Hebrew, or possibly Aramaic, and that the Greek New Testament is a mere translation and in some cases a mis-translation of the Hebrew or Aramaic originals. They have even gone so far (some of them) to conclude that Paul\\u2019s writings where he addressed the heresy they teach, were re-written by Rome and are not authentic. Of course they cannot prove this, but it is enough to cast doubt in their adherents and justify themselves in their error. These  lying Jews they are demonic when they are trying to take you away from Jesus Christ, Apostle Paul, and the New Testament..;\\n\\nToo many fundamentals, professing Christians now also,  falsely do claim that the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 was prophesied in Scripture while there is no direct support of this in the New Testament Bible even still. Now what right can Israel today use to claim again their God promised land when they have as in time pasts also openly, undeniably rejected God, even Jesus Christ as their  their God, Messiah, King, Savior, Healer, Lord, and the same Jesus who clearly predicted the expulsion of the Jews from Israel under the Romans next did not spell out the date of their return;   Zionism,   \\u201cis a secularist, largely atheistic ideology\\u201d that emerged in the late 19th century.; Once considered a small marginal doctrine among evangelicals, the false dispensationalist theology of Christian Zionism has greatly escalated, ironically falsely with the help of Jews, Messianic Jews, Judaizers and many others too. And  the Christian Church totally now rather succumbs all of the past promises made to Israel. Be careful about accepting anyone\\u2019s word about Christian Zionism do first read the Bible, New Testament for yourself and know the truth rather.; Matt 21:33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise... 43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.;\\n\\nThe true Biblical scholar can note all of the major, essential Christian doctrines have been repeated by Jesus or the apostles in the New Testament. Zionism, the reestablishment of the nation of Israel, with Jerusalem as it\\u2019s capital is not one of them.  When Christianity became a formal, legal religion in the fourth century,  Churches throughout the world  agreed on which books should form the New Testament, and they agreed on several basic statements of faith. One of the doctrinal lists created was the Apostles\\u2019 Creed, the Creed was  an accurate summary of what the apostles taught. It too does not mention Zionism. Nor does the Nicene creed. Nor many others. So  the present support of Zionism by many Christians is not a true, valid  Christian teaching . PROVE ME WRONG FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT THEN.. Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\\u201d\\u2019(Mt. 4:4,7,10 )\\n\\nPsalm NIV  78:56 But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High;  they did not keep his statutes. 57 Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless,  as unreliable as a faulty bow. 58 They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols. 59 When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely. 60 He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,the tent he had set up among men. 61 He sent the ark of his might into captivity,his splendor into the hands of the enemy. 62 He gave his people over to the sword;he was very angry with his inheritance. 63 Fire consumed their young men,and their maidens had no wedding songs; 64 their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.;\\n\\nThe reality is that because of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross the New Covenant next  replaces the Mosaic Covenant, which is commonly referred to as the \\u201cOld Covenant\\u201d. All of the The early Christian theologians saw the New Covenant in Christ as a replacement for the Mosaic Covenant for most of the last hundreds of years. The New Israel includes the Jews and the Christian Church as one body.; The new Jerusalem is solely for the bride of Christ, the Christian church as well and not for any unsaved Jews or unsaved gentiles even..  \\n(Rev 21:2 KJV) And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. \\n\\n(Rev 21:9 KJV) And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb\\u2019s wife. \\n\\nJohn 4:20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth\\n\\nNow the old, earthly Zion or the earthly Jerusalem temple, was overthrown by the Romans in 70 A.D. So the new Zion is the Heavenly kingdom of God that Jesus is yet bringing forth. Clearly all of the Old Testament references to Zion are now meant to be referred to the new Heavenly Jerusalem, the new Zion. For example-\\n\\nPs 9.11 :\\u2019Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion.\\u2019 \\n\\nUnder the new covenant, God \\u2014 the Spirit of God \\u2014 dwells in the mind of the believer, making the believer\\u2019s body, \\u2018the temple of the Holy Spirit\\u2019 [1 Cor 6.19]. So then, God would not go back to the old covenant in order to take up residence in a stone temple.. \\n\\nPs. 14.7 \\u2018O that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion, when the Lord restores his captive people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.\\u2019 \\n\\nJesus with his Free Salvation had rose out of Jerusalem, for both the the Jews and Gentiles \\u2014 who can now be set free from the bondage to the law an to the consequences of sin. . \\u2018Whom the son sets free is free in deed\\u2019[John 8.36]. \\n\\nThe Hebrew Old testament scriptures state that the Jews were God\\u2019s holy people (Deuteronomy 7:6), yet the Greek New Testament shows that now instead God\\u2019s holy people are Christians:\\n\\n13 Jesus Christ\\u202615 He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, 16 because it is written, \\u201cBe holy, for I am holy.\\u201d (1 Peter 1:13, 15-16)\\n\\n9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, (1 Peter 2:9)\\n\\n19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? (1 Corinthians 6:19)\\n\\n16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. (2 Corinthians 6:16)\\n\\nNotice that the Apostle Paul supports the idea that the temple of God now has to do with Christians, not the Jewish people (except those who are Christians and have the Holy Spirit). His wording \\u201cknow ye not\\u201d indicates that this is something that they already should have known.\\n\\nWhile He was on the earth, Jesus taught He was greater than the physical, hieron, Jewish temple:\\n\\n6 Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple. (Matthew 12:6) \\n\\nNow there is still no verse at all in the whole New Testament by Jesus that is referring to a Jewish temple being rebuilt related to the Tribulation (nor byPaul or Daniel for that matter). it should be added that even among earlier professors of Christ there has long been the view that another Temple would NOT be rebuilt.\\n\\nTHE NATION OF ISRAEL, THE JEWS \\u2013 HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF The Jerusalem temple has been already destroyed twice, all if their books, records  too now..\\n\\nLuke 13:35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. \\n\\nSadly, most Jews EVEN today are JESUS Christ rejecting followers of the OBSOLETE Judaism. Just as most of the Jews rejected their King Jesus, their Messiah, 2,000 years ago, so do almost all of the Christ-rejecting Jews today do the same.; The Bible plainly teaches in Romans 10:11-13 that God is rich unto all who call upon the name of Jesus to be forgiven of sins and saved. Eternal life is available to whosoever will call (appeal) unto the name of the Lord. Likewise, Hell fire and damnation is promised to all who refuse to obey the Gospel of Jesus Christ (2nd Thessalonians 1:8-9). \\n\\nThere is only one plan of salvation given to man by God, and it is the same for Gentile and Jew alike (Acts 4:10-12)\\n\\nLuke 21:24, \\u201cAnd they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.\\u201d Many people today, including Christians, go around quoting Zechariah 2:8 about Israel being the apple of God\\u2019s eye; but they deliberately overlook Luke 21:24 which teaches that the nation of Israel will suffer persecution, killings and defeat in war until the Lord Jesus Christ returns. God has turned to the Gentiles to preach the Gospel to the world, to provoke the Jews to jealousy (Romans 11:11). .God never said that He would bless a rebellious people. God blessed Abraham because he obeyed the voice of the most high God. And God has blessed the nations of the world, including Israel itself, through Abraham\\u2019s decedents. But God has not blessed a wicked and rebellious people. God blessed Abraham and has blessed the nations of the world, just as He promised; but God never promised to bless Israelites today who reject and disobey Him. God today does not love the Jews more than the Gentiles, nor does it mean that God respects Jews over Gentiles. Romans 2:11 plainly teaches that God is no respecter of persons. So what does Zechariah 2:8 mean then? It means that God chose to bless the nations of the world through Abraham\\u2019s seed. But God never promised to defend Israel, as clearly evidenced by Luke 21:24 \\n\\nPlease notice that God refers to Gentiles as His people in Zechariah 2:10-11, \\u201cSing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. And MANY NATIONS SHALL BE JOINED to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.\\u201d \\n\\nGalatians 3:7-9,14,16,18 and 29 wonderfully explain what these Scriptures mean, \\u201cKnow ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham \\u2026 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith \\u2026 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ \\u2026 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise \\u2026 And if ye be Christ\\u2019s, then are ye Abraham\\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\u201d Clearly we learn that all born-again Christians are also God\\u2019s people, and not just physical Jews.;\\n\\nAll Jews who truly are born-again are also God\\u2019s people according to Galatians 3:7-29.; There is no salvation promise to the Jew by birth today, except Hell if they don\\u2019t get saved by faith in their true Messiah, Jesus Christ. Sadly, the followers of Judaism today deny Jesus as the Christ, and claim falsely that their Messiah is yet to come.;the devil himself will come to the Jews next instead.;;\\n\\u201cIf you wish to go to Paradise, Heaven, New Jerusalem, Heavenly Zion, you must submit yourself to the authority of God, the King of Kings, Jesus Christ and do things his way, even down to the smallest matters of If you cannot submit yourself to the King in the small matter such as they are, why should he expect you to recognize your presence in any other matters? Would he fling open the gates of Paradise and fill his kingdom with rebels? Of Course not. \\n\\nThe name of the Lord, under the old covenant, was not,fully revealed under the new covenant, the name of \\u2018Jesus Christ\\u2019 surfaces as the name of the Lord. It has become possible to tell the name of the Lord Jesus.. the name above all names Ephesians 1: 21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: \\n\\n\\u2018Jesus\\u2019 or in Hebrew \\u2018Yah shua\\u2019 means \\u2018Yaweh saves.\\u2019 Knowing now this name suffices for all just as seeing Jesus sufficed for seeing the Father [Jn 14.8]. \\n\\nPs 110.1,2 \\u2018The LORD says to my Lord: sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. The LORD will stretch forth your strong scepter from Zion\\u2026\\u2019 \\n\\nHebrews 1: 1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;

My first song was Mosaic Me, followed by Mystical Life.  I have now written 46 songs. All come from my soul and tell my story.  I am extremely grateful for this journey as a songwriter and I have more recently started to come up with the melody for my song and explore my voice and vocal expression.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I could have this creative expression.  Jim and I have decided to go our separate ways with our respective talents and this means that Souled Out has come to the end of the road.  I will post links to youtube vids and Reverbnation link for those who might want to listen to our songs, our soul murmurs, before I close this page.\\nIt has been a challenging time, but very rewarding and very defining for me as a person.  Our band grew smaller from 4, to 3 then to 2.  I believe in what we have created; I think the songs we have created are unique and have something to offer the musical world.  Sadly, despite the best efforts with the time available to us, we have been unable to secure gigs locally.  Venues tend to favour bands who play \\\"covers\\\", it would seem.\\nSo, Souled Out fans, if you see there is a band playing nearby, that plays its own songs, show them your support.  Creating a song is nothing short of \\\"magical\\\"!  I intend to continue with writing my own songs and working with melody and voice and see where this journey takes me.\\nThank you for your support over the past few years, it has sustained me this long.\\nCatch you on the flipside.....

So I tend to go about my life on a rational whim.\\n\\nI guess it is allowable because as I see it, I have been living with me for quite some time, almost five years, almost solely on my own, forgoing most interactions, to find what it is and who it was that I was meant to be.  There is a much better sense as time has continued, but there is also some detriments to have lived a life getting to know me.  It isn't a narcissistic life at all, as usually I shun the mirror after years of battling anorexia and pointing out all the flaws I thought were there, but weren't.  I took that almost purely beautiful and innocent life, flipped it upside down through years of being amongst other patients recovering from various forms of illness, and almost became a victim to being an eternal patient, only to find that I crawled my way down and gently came out of the handstand to learn how to stand on my own two feet again.  I think I might still be a bit in child's pose, slowly raising to the pillar I remember myself as in the community, but there are still certain very philosophical and esoteric questions that exist to who it is that I am and what I ultimately would like to accomplish.  So I end up going on car rides, looking at the neighborhoods, comparing houses and landscaped grounds, comparing this neighborhood to that neighborhood, and I can easily note the differences, and comprehend the effort that it takes for the upkeep of some properties and how to delegate certain responsibilities to other services that can provide specialized care for the upkeep of the properties.  I don't discriminate between them, but I note them.  And I don't find the flaws, or the negatives, I just see that the properties are different, and that I carry preferences just like everyone else.  There are many of similar types and styles, and then there are the stand out ones in a neighborhood, or there are the ones that provides just the right combination, kind of like a recipe, and you know you have it.  I guess I would be working on both.\",\"actions\":[{\"name\":\"Comment\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/480595228689654\\/posts\\/480611562021354\"},{\"name\":\"Like\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/480595228689654\\/posts\\/480611562021354\"}],\"privacy\":{\"value\":\"\"},\"type\":\"status\",\"created_time\":\"2013-07-02T14:03:53+0000\",\"updated_time\":\"2013-07-02T14:03:53+0000\"},{\"id\":\"162728693753880_678236478869763\",\"from\":{\"category\":\"Non-profit organization\",\"category_list\":[{\"id\":\"2603\",\"name\":\"Non-Profit Organization\"}],\"name\":\"Mosaic in Des Moines\",\"id\":\"162728693753880\"},\"message\":\"\\u201cThe place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world\\u2019s deep hunger meet.\\u201d\\n\\u2015 Frederick Buechner\\n\\nWe are having a Mosaic Job Fair today from 9a-11:30a!
